# Temperature, Humidity, and LED Example

This example demonstrates how to use a DHT20 temperature and humidity sensor (connected via I2C) and a Grove LED (connected to digital port D2) with an Arduino RP2040 Connect board. 

It shows how to store sensor data in a Postgres database and control an LED remotely via database commands.

## Features

### Sensor
- Reads real temperature and humidity values from the DHT20 sensor.
- Stores the sensor value history in a Postgres database.

### Actuator
- Retrieves the last LED state from the database and sets the LED accordingly.
- Allows remote control of the LED by updating the database.
- Confirms the applied LED state back to the database.

#### Remote LED Control via SQL

To control the LED from your Postgres database, execute the following SQL commands:

```sql
-- Switch the LED off
INSERT INTO actorvalues (actor_name, actor_value)
VALUES ('led', 'off');

-- Switch the LED on
INSERT INTO actorvalues (actor_name, actor_value)
VALUES ('led', 'on');
```
